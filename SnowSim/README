2. I spoke with the Professor and because NVidia's compiler, NVCC, is not on the lab machines, I have precompiled the code.
Additionally, since CUDA was used for the program, an NVIDIA compliant card is needed to run the project.  The lab computer Aggravation has a card that has enough VRAM for the application.
To run the program, run ./SnowSim.out on Aggravation with graphical display forwarding enabled.  Like the other projects in the course, the graphical display forwarding
can be accomplished via ssh -X on Linux (Windows does not fully support all of OpenGL's calls).

3. The program has the following paramaters that can be input as arguments on launch (*Note: the scene number is set in this manner):
-n number of particles
-s scene number (either 0 or 1)
-t time step
-w lerp weight for PIC / FLIP sim
-h hardening coefficient of the snow
-r poisson ratio for the snow
-C critical compression ratio of the snow
-S critical stretch ratio of the snow

The arguments can be run as follows: ./SnowSim.out -n 100000 -s 1
Note: there exist default values for these arguments so they do not need to be set unless one is playing around with the simulation.

For reference, the default values are:
-n 10,000
-s 0
-t .01
-w .05
-h 10
-r .2
-C 2.5E-2
-S 7.5E-3
